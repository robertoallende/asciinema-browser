# Unit 01: Project Setup & MMDD Foundation

## Objective

Establish the project structure and MMDD documentation foundation. Create all necessary directories and scaffold basic files to prepare for development.

## Implementation

### Directory Structure
Create the following directories if they don't exist:
- `dev_log/` - MMDD documentation (already exists)
- `videos/` - Storage for .cast recording files
- `assets/` - Optional custom styles or scripts

### File Scaffolding
Create placeholder/basic versions of:
- `index.html` - Main gallery page (basic structure)
- `generate-list.js` - Video discovery script (placeholder with comments)
- `videos.json` - Empty array structure
- `README.md` - Project overview and usage instructions

### MMDD Documentation
- Copy `00_mmdd.md` to project (if not already present)
- Verify `00_main.md` is complete and accurate
- Create this unit file (`01_project_setup.md`)

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `videos/` directory
- `assets/` directory
- `index.html`
- `generate-list.js`
- `videos.json`
- `README.md`
- `dev_log/00_main.md`
- `dev_log/01_project_setup.md`

**Modified:**
- None (first unit)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All directories exist
- [ ] All scaffold files created with basic structure
- [ ] README.md contains project overview and setup instructions
- [ ] MMDD documentation is complete and up-to-date
- [ ] Project structure matches the plan in 00_main.md

## Status: In Progress

Ready to begin implementation.
